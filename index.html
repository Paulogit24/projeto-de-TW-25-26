    <p><strong>Happy Chaos</strong> is an athletic young man with light cerulean skin, white palms and soles, unkempt silver hair, grey eyes and a pair of short horns. A black halo with five spikes hovers above his head, similar to Jack-O' Valentine's. Rows of orange cross markings appear along the length of his arms and around his chest, collar, and back. A large black heart emblem with a golden cross and teeth appears on the center of his chest, with streaks of black ink seeming to drip down his abdomen.
        He wears a pair of distinctive glasses with orange-tinted, x-shaped lenses, black leather pants, and a single black fingerless glove on his right hand. He dual wields a pair of futuristic revolvers, which are kept holstered on each hip.
        While infiltrating G4 he dons a secret service member's jacket, worn in a casual off-the-shoulder manner, which is carried forward into his design as a playable character.

    <h2 id="story"><strong>Story</strong></h2>
    <h3 id="back"><strong>Background</strong></h3>
    <p>At some point during the Crusades, he discovered I-No in the Backyard and took half of her power in order to prevent her from becoming an entity transcending time with the potential to threaten all very existence. The Universal Will, unable to directly attack the Original, then stole that power and fused it with him, transforming him into a devilish anomaly. Burdened with omnipotence and now carrying all of humanity's hope towards living, he lost interest in concepts like good and evil, instead creating conflict to amuse himself and remind humankind of their own humanity.
       During the Crusades he would depart the Backyard in spirit form to wreak havoc, manipulating the populace to sow chaos and destruction. Among those he manipulated during this time was the vampire Nagoriyuki. Many of his actions during the Crusades were wrongly attributed to the mysterious individual known as That Man.

    <h3 id="Xrd"><strong>Guilty gear xrd</strong></h3>
    <p>When Jack-O' Valentine awakened prematurely, she sought out I-No and revealed her true nature to her, as part of a potential contingency plan should Sol Badguy fail to defeat the Universal Will, mistakenly believing that Asuka had created a second Jack-O' unit named Happy Chaos, which could be used to save I-No by restoring her humanity, in the same way that she herself could restore Aria's. Unbeknownst to her, Asuka never actually completed the unit.
        While discussing the contingency plan with Raven she explained that the other Jack-O' had still not awakened, referring to her as Happy Chaos, unaware that the Original was eavesdropping on their conversation. After Raven chastised Jack-O' and departed to confront I-No, the Original could be heard maniacally laughing, announcing that he loves the name<strong> Happy Chaos</strong> to the point where he takes it as his own.
        At some point he was absorbed by Ariels, in order to attain his knowledge of humanity and acquire power with which to battle Sol Badguy. During a celebratory banquet Ariels went mad and began slaughtering her guests, until Chipp Zanuff, sensing something demonic lurking within her, intervened. Soon after she fled, murdered her hired assassin, Bedman, and began to carry out her plan to create a new Absolute World, only to be stopped by Sol and others, eventually being taken into custody by Ky Kiske and imprisoned in Illyria, with Chaos trapped inside her.

    <h2 id="trivia"><strong>Trivia</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>He seems to be modeled after a young Iggy Pop, who would famously always perform shirtless.</li>
        <li>His X-shaped glasses and perpetual smile evoke the logo of the grunge band Nirvana</li>
        <li>His favorite drink, Milpico, is a reference to the Japanese soft drink Calpico</li>
        <li>When The Original first appears on screen during the Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign- arcade opening, the word "CHAOS" is superimposed over the image.</li>
        <li>There is a reason for why Happy Chaos and Jack-O' have identical halo ring designs, but it is currently being kept as a secret.</li>
