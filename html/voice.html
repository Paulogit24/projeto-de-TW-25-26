            <li>taunt 1: "The passage of time rids humans of attachment, but is that aging or growth? There is an answer, but what is right and wrong depends on who's talking when and where. I'm an ally and an enemy to everything all at once. I simply go with the flow. You can destroy anything, you can save anything, so long as the flow continues. So yes, there is an answer. But I have no need for conclusions. And right now, neither do you."</li>
            <li>taunt 2: "I don't care about winning, I'm just here for the pleasure. Not of the fight, but of you. You see? We may discover something that ties you, me and the world together. Your strength, your weaknesses. Your knowledge or ignorance. The burden on your shoulders that pushes you forward. Something truly unique. Any one of these things can be charming or despicable. But so far, I just find you intriguing."</li>
            <li>taunt 3: "This world is a broad, colorful carpet. But if you pull a single thread from beneath your feet and start to unravel it, you realize, in the end, that the carpet's just made of one long thread. That thread's name is necessity. Everything is connected. One may witness an unfathomable sight and call it a miracle, but that's a misnomer. It's all cause and effect. And you should never mistake necessity for fate. Humans have the freedom of choice, but it seems you know that already."</li>
