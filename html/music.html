            <h2><strong>Music</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Happy Chaos'</strong> theme is the music DRIFT <br> DRIFT represents the lesson in Strive's story mode, which is that the struggles in life occur in order for us to appreciate and remember all the good things that happen to us. All the trouble he causes in story mode isn't done with malicious intent, but rather he does so for humanity to become stronger and smarter by persevering through conflict. He sees life as a mere story with the two big arcs, climax and resolution, coming together to form greatness.
            <br>Like most of strive`s ost DRIFT is composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari (the creator of the guilty gear series) and sang by Naoki Hashimoto</p>

        <br>It took me ten years to find the answer to something
        <br>I forgot about it in two seconds
        <br>That's about it
        <br> 
        <br>Which way should we go?
        <br> 
        <br>I'll see you soon
        <br> 
        <br> Two hundred eyes on me
        <br> There's a hundred of me
        <br> 
        <br> The truth is not always real
        <br> I don't want any conclusions
        <br> 
        <br> (drift)
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br> Carried by the waves
        <br> I will just be a black sea
        <br> (drift)
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br> The finite one and the infinite one
        <br> 
        <br> It took me ten years to find the answer to something
        <br> I forgot about it in two seconds
        <br> I don't have anything that's really important to me
        <br> That's why everything is beautiful
        <br> 
        <br> Which way should we go?

        <br> A hundred mouths speak of me
        <br> A hundred of me will be born

        <br> The truth is not always real
        <br> I don't want any conclusions

        <br> (drift)
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br> Carried by the waves
        <br> I will just be a black sea
        <br> (drift)
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br> The finite one and the infinite one
        <br> 
        <br> Can you hear it, the pulses of the living?
        <br> The erratic rhythm is a grand orchestra
        <br> 
        <br> It's never the same tone
        <br> Who wants to stop this?
        <br> There can't be
        <br> When a violent storm is over
        <br> The blue sky is more beautiful than ever
        <br> You see?
        <br> I want that, That's all I want
        <br> 
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br> Carried by the waves
        <br> I will just be a black sea
        <br> (drift)
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br> Please don't stop the flow
        <br> (drift)
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br> With wandering dust
        <br> I will be a vast universe
        <br> (drift)
        <br> I drift tonight
        <br>The finite one and the infinite one
