        <p>In this page you will find a move list for <strong>Happy Chaos</strong>.
        <br>the first list list contains <strong>Chaos</strong> input moves that can be performed at no tension cost
        <br>the second list list contains <strong>Chaos</strong> OVERDRIVES that can be performed at a 50% tension cost
        <br>Note that <strong>Chaos</strong> has 2 special meters beyond the tension meter, the ammo meter and the concentration meter both of which are used in many of his moves</p>

            <td>236S H</td>
            <td>

             <br>When activated, a reticle will appear in a random location around the opponent, and then track directly to their location, focusing after a short moment. The gun can be fired by releasing the H button (as opposed to the initial press), spending a bullet and some Concentration.

             <br>Fire during At The Ready is the most important move on Happy Chaos. Its ability to be readied and used at any time allows Chaos to quickly combo or frametrap off any strike attack, and remain advantaged as a result, at the cost of resources. However, Chaos cannot block when the reticle is active.

             <br>Blockstrings can be looped indefinitely with repeated Tick Throw opportunities while Chaos has access to Fire, and can even combo off an Uncharged Dust Attack. Furthermore, Fire is so advantaged it can quickly link into Steady Aim to allow a launching combo or set up a Guard Crush for an oppressive offense.

             <br>Fire is not particularly strong in neutral on its own. Wasting Concentration is expensive, and a moving opponent is unlikely to be in danger of being hit. It is usually better to conserve Concentration and instead ready up the gun in opportune moments. For example, Chaos can ready and immediately fire his gun even on whiffing attacks, giving him an approximate 30% chance to hit the opponent if they are not already moving, covering Chaos' neutral and making him difficult to punish.

            <td>

              <br>   Entering At the Ready with 236S will add a short swing attack before aiming mode. Once the attack completes, Chaos will be in At The Ready state, similar to At The Ready H.

             <br>Extremely fast startup and on block make it a strong pressure extender, especially for its extremely high CH reward. However, its tiny range makes it prone to whiffing after most attacks if Chaos is getting pushed out with Faultless Defense. The most reliable situation to use it is after 5K, safely performing a blockstring even after FD with either dash momentum or performing a Kara Dash Cancel.

            <br>If the opponent does not use Faultless Defense, this can more economically extend pressure without expending a bullet or Concentration on Fire, especially after 6K, 6S and 2D, usually setting up for a nice spacing with 2S and f.S, and maintaining the gun to frametrap an opponent.

            <td> <br>When activated, a reticle will appear in a random location around the opponent, and then track directly to their location, focusing after a short moment. The gun can be fired by releasing the H button (as opposed to the initial press), spending a bullet and some Concentration.

                <br> Happy Chaos readies a gun in an vulnerable state, unable to move or attack, but firing in this state is very strong. When fully focused, the shot will Guard Crush an opponent, allowing Chaos to be as much as0 when cancelled into Cancel Aim, and does huge damage on hit. There is no reason to not cancel immediately from Steady Aim, as holding the stance is extremely expensive and not any faster than resetting the stance.

                <br>In neutral, Steady Aim functions as an infinite-range poke of approximately 27 Frames (19F during Curse), easily shutting down a lot of other zoning or aerial positioning.

                <br>In pressure, the hugely advantageous Guard Crush of a focused shot means Chaos can threaten a very strong Tick Throw which cannot be fuzzy jumped, and easily approach again even after Faultless Defense. However, it takes a long time to focus the shot, meaning he either requires Curse to speed it up, or spend a bullet on Fire to have the advantage to set up a quick Guard Crush. <br> </td>

             <br>   <br><strong>At the Ready Cancel</strong> <br> 

            <br>Ends At The Ready instantly, allowing Chaos to block and regain Concentration, but removes his ability to Fire. Chaos can use this in reaction to situations to enable him to block. It can also be used mid-offense to conserve Concentration.
            <br>If Chaos runs out of Concentration after firing a bullet, Cancel Aim happens automatically with 9 Frames of recovery. If Concentration runs out passively, or during recovery from a move or landing, Chaos will also be unable to move or jump for an additional 23 Frames, but can still act during this time. 
            <br> <br><strong>Steady Aim Cancel</strong><br> 
            <br>The most advantageous cancel out of Steady Aim, losing 1 bullet but is 7 frames faster than Reload.
            <br>This can be used to perform Guard Crush Loops, however losing ammunition and Concentration very quickly in the process.
            <br>Used in pressure, the additional 7 frames of advantage give Chaos more time to dash back in and reset pressure with a c.S, while spending less overall Concentration than a reset using ]H[ would. <br>

                <br>When used from At the Ready or Steady Aim, Reload will cancel the stance exiting directly to Chaos' default stance. Reload occurs fast enough that it is possible to reload one or many bullets during a combo, or remain at a significant advantage on block by cancelling Steady Aim Clean Hits.

                <br> <br>Can be freely cancelled at any time after startup.

            <td>

     <br>Partially restores the Concentration Gauge and gain a temporary buff, but with an extremely long recovery.

    <br>Due to its enormous recovery, it can be difficult to safely use. Focus can be cancelled into after a Steady Aim shot to be safe from punish at a distance. However, even perfectly cancelled from a Guard Crush shot will be slightly minus. Focus can also be routed into during combos, either early on to greatly reducing the Concentration cost of the combo, or at the end to restore some of the Concentration cost, potentially at the cost of okizeme unless breaking the wall. Additionally, cancelling into Focus after hitting 2D will leave enough time to okizeme the opponent.

    <br>The buff effect is very strong, halving all Concentration usage allows far more extensive use of At the Ready and Steady Aim, especially for their utility in pressure while maintaining access to more expensive combos. The buff effect can even be more impactful than the restored gauge.

    <br> <br>Restores +30% of the Concentration Gauge.
    <br> <br>Applies the Focus buff for 5 seconds, halving all Concentration usage.

            <br>Chaos jumps backwards and throws a curse ball forward.

            <br>If the ball does not connect it will bounce along the ground up to standing heights and continue forward until off screen.

            <br>If it connects, the opponent is then "cursed" and will begin emitting particles resembling the curse effect. While cursed Chaos' reticle will have significantly improved tracking in both At the Ready and Steady Aim. The ball has no hitstun, blockstun, and deals no damage, and is completely unblockable and intangible, going through other projectiles. Due to this Chaos is able to use Curse as an OTG that does not disrupt his Hard Knockdown timing.

                <br> Chaos backdashes and leaves a clone in front of where he originally was at the cost of some health. The clone acts a collision wall, stopping the enemy if they try to move into it and spawns behind the opponent is Chaos is close enough - this allows Chaos to use it as an artificial corner to further empower his offense if cancelled into from 2D at the cost of giving up an opportunity to recover resources. It can also be used to stall in neutral to Reload and Focus, pin down the opponent with Steady Aim, or simply reposition. If the clone and Chaos get hit at the same time, Chaos will get hit regardless, making this move unsafe against characters with long normals or specials like Johnny and his Mist Finer.  

                <br>In neutral, it is vulnerable to an opponent's 66RRC as they can hit the clone to instantly advance with a massively advantageous explosion, even punishing very late into his recovery. However, this requires them to have 50% Tension.

                <br>If it connects, the opponent is then "cursed" and will begin emitting particles resembling the curse effect. While cursed Chaos' reticle will have significantly improved tracking in both At the Ready and Steady Aim. The ball has no hitstun, blockstun, and deals no damage, and is completely unblockable and intangible, going through other projectiles. Due to this Chaos is able to use Curse as an OTG that does not disrupt his Hard Knockdown timing. 
                <br> <br>Costs 7.5% of Chaos' current health to use, until he reaches 1 health.
                <br> <br>Clone takes one hit before dissipating and has collision enabling on-hit cancels similar to hitting Chaos.
                <br> <br>If the opponent is in the corner, the clone will always spawn in front of Chaos
                <br> <br>If Chaos is at 1 Health, he will instead receive a weakened clone. The weakened clone lasts only 45 frames (data given in []), and has a significantly lower hurtbox and collision box. <br>

            <td>
                 <br>Command roll that passes through the opponent. Most commonly used as an incredibly fast crossup in pressure as Fire can be used from 16 frames onwards to convert into an easy knockdown or even wallbreak on hit. 

                <br>While very strong, Roll's weaknesses lie in its range and susceptibility to being thrown. Faultless Defense on a normal prior to the Roll can push Chaos out of distance to be able to successfully cross-up - this can be resolved by using Chaos' forward advancing normals before using Roll, such as 6K and 6S, but carries the risk of Roll attempts becoming predictable. The existence of cross-up protection also requires leaving a small gap in pressure to successfully perform a crossup with Roll - this opens up a short window for the opponent to throw you on prediction while you are passing through them. Make sure to mix up when you use roll in your pressure and to use plenty of frametraps to avoid getting caught and dissuade your opponent from going for throws. 

                <br> <br>The low profile kicks in fast enough that Chaos can roll through some delayed pressure, but keep in mind that the long recovery usually will not net a punish, or may even leave him disadvantageous. This low profile can be used to safely avoid some slower non-low crushing attacks that can interrupt Steady Aim, such as Chipp's Zansei Rouga. <br>

            <br> Happy Chaos's combo-ending Overdrive to reload all bullets, able to track an opponent from anywhere. Excellent combo ender and wallbreak tool, helps to maintain momentum.

            <br> Leaves Chaos in At The Ready once the move finishes, but inputting 2H (Cancel Aim) at any time during this move will make Chaos put away the gun immediately when this move ends. If the wall breaks, Chaos will not be in At The Ready state.

            <br> When getting a Wall Stick, or ending a combo and in need of bullets, Chaos can confirm into Deus Ex Machina for the large advantage. This super is important for maintaining Chaos's resources- if you know a Wall Stick is coming, you can cancel into Focus, and then into Deus Ex Machina, to refund most of your resources and get a Hard Knockdown.

            <br> On Wall Break, Chaos can set up Curse, use Focus, or perform okizeme. If used outside of a Wall Break, Chaos can toss out Curse or run up for a meaty, but with worse advantage than the Wall Break variant.

            <br> <br> Cannot be used if Concentration is empty.
            <br> <br> Reloads all of Chaos' ammo on Super Flash, even if the attack does not hit.

            <td>
            <br> A Pseudo-Roman Cancel, which fully restores Concentration and applies a Focus buff.

            <br> With its extremely short 11F duration, Chaos is still advantageous off many of his common pressure moves like 2D or 6S, making it a useful pressure reset when Concentration is low, both from afar and at point-blank. Furthermore, After a Guard Crushing Steady Aim shot, Chaos is excessively advantaged, able to cross large distances and still frametrap.

            <br> During Positive Bonus, Super Focus can be used several times, as its biggest weakness with Tension Penalty is almost entirely nullified, while resetting into enough pressure to regain the Tension to use it again.

            <br> <br> Applies the Focus buff for 5 seconds, halving all Concentration usage.
            <br> <br> Has an extended 7 2⁄3 second Tension Penalty, lowering Tension for significantly longer than most Overdrives.
            <br> <br> Removes At The Ready state if Chaos was in it.
